An adaptation of the crkbd keyboard. It contains a 4x6 matrix and three thumb keys. It's also MX and Choc hotswappable.

All of the KiCad files needed to print the pcb are included. I know that the gerber files included are enough to print through JLCPCB.

I have dxf files to get plates made for the pcb's, but I won't have access to that computer for at least a week or two.
